# Hi there üëã I'm Pradyut Kumar Ghosh!
üéØ Aspiring **Full Stack QA Engineer** | üîç Passionate about building, breaking, and perfecting web systems.

## Welcome to my GitHub! I'm actively building my career in Full Stack QA and cloud combining development skills with a keen eye for testing and automation. I strive to deliver robust, testable, and scalable applications.

üß™ I believe QA is not just about finding bugs‚Äîit's about ensuring quality at every stage of the software lifecycle. From writing test cases and automating UI/API testing to integrating testing in DevOps workflows and contributing to full stack development, I aim to bridge the gap between development and QA.

üöÄ Currently expanding my skills in:
- Test automation frameworks (Selenium, Playwright)
- CI/CD & DevOps
- Full stack development
- Cloud
- Security and performance testing
